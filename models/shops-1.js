			"This alleyway kiosk is groundzero for the boutique coffee revolution in San Francisco. There's always a line here... even in the late afternoon. The secret sauce? A promise. James Freeman, the Bill Walsh of SF coffee connoisseurship, founded BB on a commitment to use the “finest organic, and pesticide-free, shade-grown beans” and serve them less than “48 hours out of the roaster.” The food options are spartan, but we like the reasonable prices on the not-so-sweet baked goods. The baristas also give us far less attitude than those at any of the other coffee-geek havens; we like that we don't feel challenged to prove that we're cool enough to patronize this place."

			"Four Barrel coffee and treats. While many bars in the Mission are flooded with people glued to their laptops, Four Barrel is a nice reminder that coffee shops should be a social space. With well-sourced and delicious coffee, Four Barrel is the perfect spot for a casual business meeting or gossip session with your buds. The outdoor seating and delicious treats (maple-bacon dynamo donuts!) is the whipped cream on my mocha."
