			"This alleyway kiosk is groundzero for the boutique coffee revolution in San Francisco. There's always a line here, even in the late afternoon. How do they do it? James Freeman, a coffee connoisseurship, founded the Blue Bottle on the vow to only sell coffee made from the “finest organic, and pesticide-free, shade-grown beans” and serve it less than “48 hours out of the roaster.” The food choices are fairly limited to not so sweat baked goods, but the prices are reasonable. The baristas also have less attitude than those at any of the other coffee havens. They manage to be grounded and connect with they clientele."

			"While many coffee shops in the Mission are flooded with people working on laptops, Four Barrel is not: \"Without wi-fi and plugs for laptops, we noticed our customers getting their drinks in porcelain cups and talking to each other. sharing tables. hanging out.\" Oh, and the coffee is good, not just he beans, but how they roast it and make it: \"we are old-fashioned about roasting. we rely on highly trained people, not machines, to see through the intention of our roasting style: to highlight the intrinsic qualities of a coffee that drove us to buy it in the first place\" Four Barrel is the perfect spot for a casual meeting or chatting with friends. They have outdoor seating and delicious treats, such as maple-bacon dynamo donuts."
