			"This is a special place with a clean, industrial look. One of the owners is the son of Mr. Espresso. This is a major destination of the startup crowd. On a sunny day expect to see may MacBooks. Besides great breakfast and lunches, they offer really great coffee. \"he best experience begins with the coffee itself, and that means working with an extraordinary roaster. At Coffee Bar, all of our beans are sourced directly from Mr. Espresso, a Bay Area roasting institution since the 1970s. Their attention to responsibly-sourced and prepared beans adds an irreplaceable dynamic to the experience we strive to create.\""
