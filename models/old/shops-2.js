			"Crossroads Cafe seems aptly named due to its main features as a book store and peaceful garden. If you are looking for a place to get out the laptop and get some work done, this place is not for you. Same goes if you are meeting someone to show them an online demo of your latest project. Why? No WiFi is available at Crossroads Cafe. While former inhabitants of Pier 39 used to love the convenience of this peaceful spot, it can still prove as a nice spot to chat if you are not in a hurry. It may be a bit out of the way for most these days."

			"The Grove is conveniently located between downtown and SOMA, and its food “seems” like it is a bit healthier than the norm. Add to that a fireplace or nice outdoor seating, and the ambiance is good too. The downside for me is you get a code for the WiFi when you pay. Not only that, it can be hard to find a seat if you are there anywhere near lunch time. The bottom line is that it might be a good spot to catch up with a friend you’ve met before. They are likely someone you don’t have to worry about getting a seat right away with, and you don’t have to hear every single word they are saying."
