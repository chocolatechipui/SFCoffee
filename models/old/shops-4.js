			"Can't a guy keep one secret? Guess not. A gem on the corner of Bryant x Florida, the Coffee Bar warrants a spot in your regular rotation. They know their beans... one of the owners is the son of Mr. Espresso. The clean, industrial look is surprisingly welcoming. Lots of Silicon Valley rainmakers play hooky here. On a spring day, expect abundant sunshine and MacBooks."
