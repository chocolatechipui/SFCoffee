			"Ritual pioneered the roastery-cum-cafe experience in the Mission. They source their own beans, seeking out the best varietals by geography, altitude, soil, shade, and harvests. Ritual brews both coffee and controversy, ranging from the Soviet-inspired logo to the removal of the power outlets. (Sorry, all day Tweeters.) But they offer a great cup of coffee and they've even shared their brewing guide."

			"The Grind Cafe has partnered with some of the titans of SF dining, Mr Espresso, Boudin Bakery and Niman Ranch. Lucky they have vaulted ceilings to provide sufficient headroom and natural lighting. There's free Wi-Fi during the week. On the weekends, hit up the french toast croissant wopped with fruit. Don't worry, it won't hit back. This is your refuge from the Haight street panhandling."
