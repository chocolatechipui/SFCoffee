			"Ritual pioneered the roastery-cafe experience in the Mission. Ritual has been a pioneer in this delicious shift in coffee consciousness since they opened our doors on Valencia Street in 2005 and started what some call a coffee revolution in San Francisco. Their mission: \"to present these coffees to our customers in the same sublime condition that we tasted them, both by serving them seasonally, to preserve their freshness, and by roasting them with the intention of accentuating the intrinsic qualities within.\" Oh, and they have no wifi here, so don't bother bringing your laptop."

There's free Wi-Fi during the week. There is a variety of things to eat. But the coffee is the best. The Grind was started with the simple goal of \"serving a fresh product with the best quality ingredients consistently\". They've been at it for fifteen years now."
