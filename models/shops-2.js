			"Crossroads Cafe features a book store and peaceful garden. There is no wifi at this location, so this is not a place to hunker down with a laptop or show off a demo to someone. Crossroads is managed by Delancey Street. They build everything themselves and take great pride in the quality of the coffee and food that they serve there. The decor is unique and makes a great place to get together with friends or family for great coffee, treats and conversation."

			"The Grove is located in Hayes Valley, not far from Van Ness and Market. Its food seems a bit healthier than the norm. It's got an indoor fireplace and nice outdoor seating, and great ambiance. It feels like a big den. The only downside is this place can get crowded during peak hours at noon and during dinner time, meaning you may need to wait to sit down. But, once you're seating, you'll enjoy the coffee and other eatables this place offers."
