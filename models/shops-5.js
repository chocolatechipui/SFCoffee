			"Sorry folks, the Philz phenomenom is creeping outside SF. The reason? Discerning folks appreciate over 20 handmade coffees brewed one cup at a time. The go-to order is the Tesora blend. For special occassions, try the mint mojito iced coffee... smooth and chocolatey, decadent and refreshing. Patrons seem to be able to concentrate even though the pours probably have 3x the caffeine."

			"Bernie's is much too humble... \"a local coffee shop?\" no, THE local coffee shop with bed and breakfast-like amicability and tranquility. The owner, a third generation Noe Valley resident, will quickly match your face with your name and drink of choice. Reciprocate her smile and you'll have another friend along with a free refill. Milkbones gratis for the dogs (the people food is good too)."
