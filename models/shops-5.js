			"Philz has over 30 blends of handlmade coffees brewed one cup at a time. The method is similar to a pour-over process but with a twist. From then on, each cup was made one cup at a time, allowing for specificity and diversity in taste for the individual person and brew. Be forewarned, the coffee here probably has 3 times the caffeine of other coffees, if that matters. Although they have such incredible blends, they also have a variety of single origin beans available from Colombian, African, Yemen, Kenyan, Sumatra, etc."

			"Bernie's is a special place, \"a local coffee shop?\" no, it's a coffee shop with the friendliness and peacefulness of a bed and breakfast inn. Bernie's is a coffee shop with a comfy, family feeling about it. The staff are friendly and know their clientele. It's a real community space where people enjoy getting together and has a kid-friendly corner. Oh, and yummy treats for you and your dog while you're enjoying your coffee."
